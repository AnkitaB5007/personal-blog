![OSI Model](/uploads/OSI.jpg)

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model defines how data moves through a network, from one device to another. It has seven layers, each with specific functions. Let's explore the key layers covered in this post.

---

## Physical Layer (Layer 1)

The Physical Layer is the foundation of the OSI Model. It deals with the physical connection between devices.

### Functions

- Converts data to signals and back (encoding/decoding).
- Handles modulation and demodulation.
- Manages transmission modes: simplex, half-duplex, full-duplex.
- Determines speed (bitrate) of data transfer.

### Common Protocols

- **Ethernet (IEEE 802.3):** Standard for wired networks.
- **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11):** Wireless networking.
- **Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1):** Short-range wireless.
- **USB:** Connects devices over short distances.

### Device Arrangement (Topology)

- Devices can be arranged in star, bus, ring, or mesh topologies.
- *(Tip: Add diagrams to visualize these topologies.)*

### Limitations

- Only transmits raw bits; no interpretation.
- Vulnerable to physical damage (e.g., broken cables).

## Data-Link Layer (Layer 2)

The Data-Link Layer ensures reliable data transfer between two directly connected nodes.

### Functions

- **Framing:** Adds headers/trailers to mark data boundaries.
- **Error Detection:** Uses parity checks, checksums, CRC.
- **Error Correction:** Retransmits lost or corrupted frames.
- **Flow Control:** Prevents sender from overwhelming receiver.
- **Addressing:** Uses MAC addresses for device identification.

### Common Protocols

- SDLC (Synchronous Data Link Control)
- HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control)
- SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol)
- PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)
- LAP (Link Access Procedure)
- LCP (Link Control Protocol)
- NCP (Network Control Protocol)

### Limitations

- No encryption or authentication.
- Only manages device-to-device communication.
- Can suffer from congestion and collisions.

## Presentation Layer (Layer 6)

The Presentation Layer formats and secures data for the application layer.

### Functions

- **Translation:** Converts data formats (e.g., ASCII to EBCDIC).
- **Encryption/Decryption:** Secures data using protocols like SSL or TLS.
